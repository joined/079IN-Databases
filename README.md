# [079IN] Databases

This repository contains the LaTeX code for the final report of the 079IN Databases course at the University of Trieste, taught in 2014/15.

The report is about the design of a database for a network of libraries, managing books and such. It is in **Italian**.

It's probably a good display of the capabilities of the `tikz-er2` package.

The code for the database can be found in `database_bibfvg.sql`. The output PDF is `tesina.pdf`.

The theme "Torino" by [Marco Barisone](http://blog.barisione.org/2007-09/torino-a-pretty-theme-for-latex-beamer/) was used.
